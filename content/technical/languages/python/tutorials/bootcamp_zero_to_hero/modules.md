- if we want to import a module
 ```
 import module_name
 ```

 ```python
 import math

 math.sqrt(4)
 ```
 - all math related functionalities are in math module

 ```python

 from math import sqrt  # instead of importing everything import only specific
sqrt(4)
 ```
 - all import statements should be top of your code
 - what if we want to download exteral module
 -  anaconda already did that for us
 - if we still want 

 ```bash
 conda install *module name*

 ```

  ```bash
 conda install flask

 ```

 - what if anaconda doesnot have that package
 - we can use `pip` python management sysytem which allows us to install packages from Internet
