> All vitamins and minerals play an extremely important role in our body acting as catalysts , co-enzymes(help enzymes) and cofactors(these support chemical and metabolic reactions) of our metaboilc reations

- they dont provide body with any energy but they are important so that body can use that energy or calories well

- A high intake of processed food , **stress** and other lifestyle like smoking ,late nights and inactivity are increasing need of vitamins and minerals and reducing the ability to absorb them

- None of them can work in isolation , for calcium to do its work it needs 24 other nutrients to be present in right amount at right time

- for **Iron** , it requires adequate protein , vitamin **B** ans **C** to form heamoglobin(blood)

# Vitamin A

- whole and low fat milk

- dark leafy vegetables

- all orange , yello vegetables

- Forms of vitamin A found in plant sources are called **carotene**

> We need it because it supports our immune functions , helps improve eye sight , crucial for growth and development in the body

- Carotene is a potent antioxiadnt which protects cells against free radicals

> Take it when you are stressed or travelling

- Why you get too much tires after crash diet , too much exercise or a period of stress is due to deficiency of vitamin A

- So if your lifestyle is stressed most of the time you need more vitamin A

- Best way is to increase carotene content

- Best time to take vitamin A is after a stressful period of day ,after a big workout or a long flight

- Carotenes are also a good way of **combating acne** , help prevent cancer , maintain healthy reproductive system and reduce vaginal infections

  - most animals can make their own vitamin c but human body cannot
  - good news is there is a plenty of vitamin c in the most of food we eat
  - Vitamin B and C are water soluble , that means they are are gone when the water is deledted from our body
  - So our body needs a fresh supply daily
  - vitamin C can be easily lost something as simple as cutting fruits and vegetables
  - we loose it more when we keep them covered in refrigirator
  - so anything that increases the exposure of fruits and vegetables can lead to almost 90% loss of vitamin C

- As the fibre moves in our intestine it picks up the wastes and adds bulk to your stools
- it makes going to toilet a pleasurable experience
- it will reduce the time spent on downloading
- Its clear that fibre is important if

  - we want clear stomach
