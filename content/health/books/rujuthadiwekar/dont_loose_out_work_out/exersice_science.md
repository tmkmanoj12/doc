- The primary goal of excersice is that it brings about muscular contradiction
- the heart will go thorugh major adaptation based on the training that you subject your body to
- latest studies shows that sitting or plain inactivity characterized by lack of muscualr contradiction is a independent risk factor to delevloping 
lifestyle diseases like obesity  , diabeties , heart disease disc prolapse , hernia , blood pressure,  arthiritis, cancer and everything in between 

#### Stting is the new Smoking

- Just smoking was remains an independent factor of obesity , heart disease and cancer

- Independent factor means even you everything required(sleep at proper time , workout , eat homecooked food) but if you sitting an considerable amount of time sitting / inactive then you are screwed

#### Phisical Activity
- We must know the effects of lack of physical activities and the risk it brings will not be magically washed away wih one hour in the gym
- what you do for 23 hours of the day matters compared to what you do 1 hour in gym
- It takes as little as 150 minutes a week of excersice per week to improve blood glucose tolerance  , reduce bodt fat and the risk to all possible lifestyle related diseases

#### Dont blame your Genes

#### The Best Excersice

- You have to keep in balance with the entire body but not on single type of excersice
- you need to have both aerobic and anerobic programs with you

#### Info about Heart
- heart is placed in left part of chest
- it is the size of your fist but it has to pump blood from your brain to toe 
- it is divided four distinct chambers each performing a different task
- the upper chambers are called auricles and the lower chambers are called ventricles
- the left ventricle is important to us
- this chamber pumps oxegenated blood to the body
- excersice good for heart means , it will increase size and strenght of heart muscle
- As  a response from aerobic or cardio or endurance the left ventricle will go through an increase in sizre and becomes bigger than it originally was
- But it also important that with aneoribic exercises like gymming , sprinting will also help in developing a thicker wall , with a larger and more efficient capillary network leading to increase in strength as well
- For improvements of heart health both training adaptations of a large ventricular cavity and the strength of the wall are essential
- Only then there will be a decrease of blood lipid profile , BP , blood sugar
- Overdoing only one type like going for a walk everyday and not strenght training is only half benifit

#### Enlarged heart / Athletes paradox

- Enlarged heat is a common heart ailment , an adaptation that the kind heart goes through in response to hypertension or high blood pressure
- this enlarged heart is often seen in sedentary people
- No excersie and high body weight is identified as serious risk to heart
- Now atheletic training or even recreational exercise can bring about the same adaptation - enlarged heart
- The difference is that people who workout , the heart enlarges beacuse it gets bigger in size , strength and vascularity and in  sedentary folk it enlarges to make up for the lack of exact same things
- the enlarged heart in people who work out regulary is also called atheletes heart and is charaterized by low or normal BP levels and low body fat levels

#### Energy systems of our body
- before starting the excersice you need to understand the energy systems
- Body produces energy in 3 ways to carry out any task / activity /excersice
- The intensity of your acitvity decides which energy will dominate
- depending on the task one will work more than other
    - Aerobic system
    - Anaerobic systems
        - Glycogen lactic acid system
        - ATP-CP system
- The aerobic system follows aerobic pathway and that means muscles get to use oxygen 
- This pathway was developed to carry out tasks that go on for a long time
- For example to equip you with the stamina to walk from one village to another or from home to school etc or long distance running
- so this system can help you carry out tasks that not high intensity but of high voulme
- almost every day activities are aerobic activities
- The ATP- CTP , glycogen lactic acid system follow the anerobic pathway which means they function in the absence of oxygen
- It doesnot mean there is no oxygen avaialable
- It means the task was completed so fast that oxygen coulnt reach the working muscle group
- Working without oxygen means that muscles will be able to work for a very short duration of time beacuse there is only so much you can sustain in the abscence of oxygen
- Since they last for very short period of time , they can carry really high intensity tasks
- Why human body is designed in such a way beacuse there are a lot high intensity tasks that we need to carry during short period of duration
- for eg : slapping someone out of anger
- There  are a whole lot of different enzymes , fuel substrates, electron trainsfer systems,muscle fibre types,genetics, and environment factors etc.
- but we need to understand fuel and msucle type to get the most of our workout/ results.

#### Fuel and muscle type
- Now when you say body should be toned , you mean that you need to develop more muscle mass thatt you currently have
- because you know that muscle is only the metabolic active tissue which revs up your metabolism, burns fat ,makes you look young , attractive hot and keeps you fertile
- Muslcle is divided into two types
    - oxidative (or red or slow twich or Type1) muscle fibres
    - non-oxidative (or white or fast twicth or Type 2) muscle fibres
- Type 2 is divided into 2 types
    - Type2a
    - Type2b
- The aerobic system employs the Type 1 or slow twitch muscle fibres that can contract and carry out work for longer periods of time , since it opertes in the presence of the oxygen
- It can burn below as fuel to drive energy
    - carbohydrate
    - protein
    - fat 
- They have a lot of mitochondria things which help you in oxidize dat and also give it the red appearance

> Type 1 / Slow Twitch/ Red - Low Intensity /Long Duration aeroic  - Carb , protein /Fat as fuel

- Type 2 ot the Fast Twitch muscle fibres dont have much mitochondria so they work when you are using the anerobic energy system
- Since they dont have  too much mitochondria or myoglobin (the cousin of heamoglobin and found inside muscle tissue like Hb the myoglobin binds to oxygen too forming O2 - myoglobin) they appear less red or in fact white
- the glycogen-lactic acid systems employs the Type 2 a muscle fibres and as the name sugeests they use carbs in the form of glycogen stored in muscle and liver as fuel
- Type 2a are the most verstatile muscle fibres and keep the ability to use /generate forces both aerobically and anerobically
- The ATP-CP or the alactic acid system employs the Type 2 b fibre type and uses the stored and ready to use energy molecule Adesonisine Tiphosphate to produce real quick energy in short span of time

>Type 2 /Fast twitch /White - High Intensity / Short Duration - Glycogen /ATP as fuel

#### Types of Fuel
- There are 3 types of sources of energy that the body uses
    - ATP-CP
    - Carbs
    - Fats
    - Proteins

- __ATP-CP__
    - Adenosine Tri Phosphate is readily avaialable and stored molecule in our muscles
    - I consists of adenosine component and 3 High energy phosphate groups can be represented as

    " Adenosine"  <====> (P) <====>(P) <====>(P)
    - when the muscles need energy they break down one of the phosphate bonds resulting in 1 ADP molecule , a free phosphate and significant amount of energy
    - Another chemical that provides stored energy is Creatine Phosphate (CP)
    - However the cells cant use  CP directly , but instead use if for conversion of ADP to ATP , Like ATP , CP is also in short supply and needs to be constantly resybthesixed
    - The ATP-CP cycle is not dependednt in the presence of oxygen and is therefore extremenly important for anerobic type of activities
    - Beacuse it is readily available in muscules for use , the body relies on this when it has to perform any task quickly in short duration of time
- __Carbs__
    - Carbs from food are broken down into glucose , which is transported through blood and stored in muscles and liver as glycogen (cluster of glucose molecules)
    - In the absence of oxygen (anerobic mettabolism) , 1 glucose molecule at a time from glycogen is broken down into an intermediate product called pyruvic and then lactic acid and this reaction generates ATP( 2 molecule of ATP for 1 molecule of glucose)
    - In the presence of oxygen (aerobic metabolism),the pyruvic acid doesnot get coverted to lactic acid instead after a series od reactions , to carbon dioxide and water puls 36 molecules of ATP
    - So Aerobically more energy (ATP) can be procuced per molecule od glucose as compared to anerobic .Also aerobically there are fewer exercise by products than anerobic (Which produces the muscle fatiguing lactic acid)
- __Fats__
    - Our body typically stores fat as triglycerides in both fat cells (or adipose tissue) and in the skeletal muscle cell
    - when the body employs aerobic pathway , it can use fat as fuel by breaking down tryglecirides  from adipose tissue (also called adipocytes)
    into free fatty acids(FFA) and transporting them via blood to the working muscle tissue where they are converted to ATP
    - One FFA produces 147 ATP molecules
    - Aerobically fat(147 ATP) produces more than carbs(36 ATP)
    - Anerobically fat cannot be used  as a fuel but when performing anerobic activity with intervening resting periods the FFA from Blood play a minor role as energy source
- __Proteins__

    - Technically body can use protein as fuel too (aerobically )
    - However it is only used as fuel in extreme conditions
    - and mostly used for its main purpose - that of building and reparing the body tissue
    - It is estimated that not more than 5-10% of body's total energy comes from protein

- __Summary__
    - For anerobic path way prestored ATP and glycogen are the only sources of fuel
    - For aerobic pathway all three - carbs, fats, proteins can be used as fuel
    - Although aerobically fat appears to be most important source of fuel , the fact that carbs are more efficient(need fewer molecules for oxidation) makes them important as a starting fuel source , with fat taking over later
    - Thats why it is aloways said that fat is always bured in carbohydrate flame

#### The Miracle of After Burn

- You burn calories as a result of activity
- but it is not easy to calculate (Energy Excersice Expenditure )EEE - Technical terms for calories burnt
- We should not beileive the Thread mill reading
- and also consuming less calories per day will lead to weight loss - yes it does but it is not accurate
- Most of the varibales are there like age ,sex, preworkout meal , meal throughout the week etc.
- Even the doctors are not sure how much you spent

- What we know
- EEE is a combination of calories burned during excersice and after due to excerscie
- Calories burned are direclty proportinal to oxygen consumed(this is how calories measured in labs)
- So two parts of EEE
- Calories burned during Excersice
    - During aeobic activity oxygen consumption is increased so calories are burned 
    - Oxygen uptake is also proportinal to the heat expenditure during excersice
    - This is why you sweat so much more duringaerobic activities like runnning ,dance, cycling
    - And during anerobic activity oxygen consumption is less so less calories are burned
    
- Calories burned  post excersice
    - For aerobic activity  , hardly cany extra oxygen is consumed above what is needed at rest
    - And for aerobic activity  - Post excersice  , a _lot more oxygen_ is needed to restore the body to its resting state(Breathing , circulation , digestion , hormones) 
    - and to adapt to excersice by recovering and reaparining from the microscopic tissue damage(anabolism), this is called oxygen debt or debit also known as EPOC(Excess post exercise oxygen consumption) , a more poular term after burn.

- So after burn as compared to oxygen required at rest is the crucial factor here
- after burn is divided into 2 parts
    - Alactic acid debt  : 
        - Amount of oxygen required to replenish ATP-CP stores in the muscles
        - This is carried out aerobically and happens quicky in about three to four minutes of stopping the excersice
        - This is called the rapid segment of oxygen debt
    - Lactic acid debt : 
        - This is linked to amount of lactic acid that gets produced during excersice and is dependent on intensity , duration and type of exercise
        - EPOC(Excess post excersice oxygen consumption) does the job by removing lactic acid and accumulation from musucles,restoring glycoge stores , bringing body temperature back to resting state
        - This slow segment of oxygen debt and can take up to 24 to 48 hours  based on the intensity of the workout
        - In Other words due to performing anerobic activity you will burn more calories (exactly burn more fat) for as long as 24 to 48 hours post excersice
- After burn for anerobic activities is exponentially higher than what is for aerobic excersice
- Essentially how much fat burning you will acheive and therefore the final effect on your body composition (how thin,  actually how lean and young you look  ) is based on accumulative effect of after brun through the week
- So if we do only aerobic will we get optimum results
- No we need noth aerobic and anerobic excersices like wholesome food we need wholesome excersice
