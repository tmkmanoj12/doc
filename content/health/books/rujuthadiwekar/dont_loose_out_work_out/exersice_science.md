- The primary goal of excersice is that it brings about muscualr contradiction
- the heart will go thorugh major adaptation based on the training that you subject your body to
- latest studies shows that sitting or plain inactivity characterized by lack of muscualr contradiction is a independent risk factor to delevloping 
lifestyle diseases like obesity  , diabeties , heart disease disc prolapse , hernia , blood pressure,  arthiritis, cancer and everything in between 

#### Stting is the new Smoking

- Just smoking was remains an independent factor of obesity , heart disease and cancer

- Independent factor means even you everything required(sleep at proper time , workout , eat homecooked food) but if you sitting an considerable amount of time sitting / inactive then you are screwed

#### Phisical Activity
- We must know the effects of lack of physical activities and the risk it brings will not be magically washed away wih one hour in the gym
- what you do for 23 hours of the day matters compared to what you do 1 hour in gym
- It takes as little as 150 minutes a week of excersice per week to improve blood glucose tolerance  , reduce bodt fat and the risk to all possible lifestyle related diseases

#### Dont blame your Genes

#### The Best Excersice

- You have to keep in balance with the entire body but not on single type of excersice
- you need to have both aerobic and anerobic programs with you

#### Info about Heart
- heart is placed in left part of chest
- it is the size of your fist but it has to pump blood from your brain to toe 
- it is divided four distinct chambers each performing a different task
- the upper chambers are called auricles and the lower chambers are called ventricles
- the left ventricle is important to us
- this chamber pumps oxegenated blood to the body
- excersice good for heart means , it will increase size and strenght of heart muscle
- As  a response from aerobic or cardio or endurance the left ventricle will go through an increase in sizre and becomes bigger than it originally was
- But it also important that with aneoribic exercises like gymming , sprinting will also help in developing a thicker wall , with a larger and more efficient capillary network leading to increase in strength as well
- For improvements of heart health both training adaptations of a large ventricular cavity and the strength of the wall are essential
- Only then there will be a decrease of blood lipid profile , BP , blood sugar
- Overdoing only one type like going for a walk everyday and not strenght training is only half benifit

#### Enlarged heart / Athletes paradox

- Enlarged heat is a common heart ailment , an adaptation that the kind heart goes through in response to hypertension or high blood pressure
- this enlarged heart is often seen in sedentary people
- No excersie and high body weight is identified as serious risk to heart
- Now atheletic training or even recreational exercise can bring about the same adaptation - enlarged heart
- The difference is that people who workout , the heart enlarges beacuse it gets bigger in size , strength and vascularity and in  sedentary folk it enlarges to make up for the lack of exact same things
- the enlarged heart in people who work out regulary is also called atheletes heart and is charaterized by low or normal BP levels and low body fat levels
