- catabolism = breakdown or destruction of cells - ageing
- to reduce catabolism we need to get more activity in life

# Metabolism = break down + build up

- life blesses us anabolism = the ability to build our body cells

- also habits, beleifs , character , destiny and our workout routine

- anabolism + catabolism

- the longer you spend time on earth the lower your metabolism

- there are many reasons

  - we get progressively fat, fatter , fattest
  - may be currently fattest
  - your fat free mass (bones and muscles) gets less ans less
  - evolution built us like that over time e loose lean tissue and increase fat mass

#### Skeleto muscular changes

- size of our muscle cell = cross-section of our muscle fiber goes through attrophy (shrinkage) while size of the fat cell increases
- post 80 we see shrinkage of bone more and loose our strength
- our bone mineral density goes down and our bone matrix gettting weaker
- main thing is calcium - more than 4% of our total weight comes from calcium
- as we age and out weight goes up our net calicum weight goes down dur to bone loss

- bone matrix - bone structure is like fish net where calcium will go and sit and make a denser bone

- when it becomes weak our bones , joints , tendons , ligaments stops supporting our body weight
- most of the time there is a odemea or swelling as fluid starts collecting in joints , first in weight bearing joints as ankles and knees take the max toll , a small slip leads to fracture

#### Hormonal changes

- estrogen and testosterone levels will drop
- Main thing is insulin sensitivity
- insulin is supposed to be an anabolic hormone which helps the body grow
- as it looses its power our body will be in a starved state for the dily dose of nutrient intake and thats how diabeties come
- but naturally we will see this @50+ but now as we are lazy it is coming at 25
- so even if your age is 25 your biological age is 50+

#### All the involuntary systems change
- our heart , lungs and digestive sysytems also change , thier efficiency decrease under same workload
