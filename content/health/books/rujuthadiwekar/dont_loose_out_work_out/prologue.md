- catabolism = breakdown or destruction of cells - ageing
- to reduce catabolism we need to get more activity in life

# Metabolism = break down + build up

- life blesses us anabolism = the ability to build our body cells

- also habits, beleifs , character , destiny and our workout routine

- anabolism + catabolism

- the longer you spend time on earth the lower your metabolism

- there are many reasons

  - we get progressively fat, fatter , fattest
  - may be currently fattest
  - your fat free mass (bones and muscles) gets less ans less
  - evolution built us like that over time e loose lean tissue and increase fat mass

#### Skeleto muscular changes

- size of our muscle cell = cross-section of our muscle fiber goes through attrophy (shrinkage) while size of the fat cell increases
- post 80 we see shrinkage of bone more and loose our strength
- our bone mineral density goes down and our bone matrix gettting weaker
- main thing is calcium - more than 4% of our total weight comes from calcium
- as we age and out weight goes up our net calicum weight goes down dur to bone loss

- bone matrix - bone structure is like fish net where calcium will go and sit and make a denser bone

- when it becomes weak our bones , joints , tendons , ligaments stops supporting our body weight
- most of the time there is a odemea or swelling as fluid starts collecting in joints , first in weight bearing joints as ankles and knees take the max toll , a small slip leads to fracture

#### Hormonal changes

- estrogen and testosterone levels will drop
- Main thing is insulin sensitivity
- insulin is supposed to be an anabolic hormone which helps the body grow
- as it looses its power our body will be in a starved state for the dily dose of nutrient intake and thats how diabeties come
- but naturally we will see this @50+ but now as we are lazy it is coming at 25
- so even if your age is 25 your biological age is 50+

#### All the involuntary systems change
- our heart , lungs and digestive sysytems also change , thier efficiency decrease under same workload

- something is better than nothing

- our brain is preprogrammed fot instant rewards
- so we want to eat biryani , pizza , cake even though  we know it is going to cause problems later
- so exersice and well being takes time , be prepared for that

#### How exersice antiages

- Every time you workout out body undergoes through a microsopic breakdown called catabolic reaction
- the muscualar tissue which had gone through breakdown is reapaired by the body called anabolism 
- the process is called adaptation
- if our body is convinced that you are going to do regular exercise then it ensures that it repairs and rebuilds enough tissue so that next time youu workout at the same load or training intensity no breakdown will be caused
- this leads to hypertrophy or increase in the muscle tissue and builds density of bones , reversing the very process of ageing
- in short working out is a catabaloic process that supports anabolism
- so you will be reversing the process of breakdown or ageing in the body by proving to your body's intelligence that you are using your muscles so it should loose them or break them down through atrophy
- will this also lead to weight loss , of course yes
- one working out is a calorie burning process and the repair and rebuiling process is another calorie burner and this process can take up to 48 hours at times , which means you burn more calories for 2 days post a workout session
- and as your workout changes your body composition or ensures that we have more muscle compared to dat, it accelerates your basal metabolism too 
- without working out having sedentary lifestyle will cause you to have more fat than muscle and will decrease your BMR
- __because fat is an inert tissue it doesnot demand calories from your body to maintain itself__
- it is easier for your body to keep it than your muscle
- Other things which can put you in anabolic zone are 
- A good eating plan :
    - when you eat a low calorie / low fat  or some other diet you breakdown much more in your body than your ability to build up,
    - you feel very low in energy ,you can t even think of gymming or lifting your hand to straighten your hair 
    - result - ageing and accelerated ageing because of fat deposition
    - A diet that is high in nutirents make you feel in the zone to exersice
    - When you exersice you breakdown ,yes but building up process cost more than breakdown
    - result - fat loss + younger skin hair face and waist
- Good quality sleep :
    - An irregular bedtime is the biggest contributor to skipping exersice
    - With poor quality sleep you dint have enough anaboilc hormones,not just that all anabolic hormones like growth hormones etc which results in a fatter and older you
- Healthy relationships 
    - if you have a stressful boss or an unstable partner you will age quickly
    - if you take care of these things earlier in like your catabolic is low and anabloic is dominated
- __Depression__ and feeling low is caused by a decrease in _serotonin_ and _norepinephrine_
- So you can workout or dance to walk out of depression
- Studies have shown that physical activity is best comapred to antidepressants

- __More catabolism than anabolism  = fat deposition__
- if the cataboilc component in your metabolism is higher than the anablic component then there is an increase in body fat stores
- only thing you can do in your daily life is to ensure that there is a big surge in calories or energy required by anabolism is work out and workout at an intensity that is respectful
- In short , dont crawl when you can walk
- the other side of the equation if catabolism is stronger than the anabolism , where will be the defieciency be compensated from ? __fat tissue__
- all the creams and surguries will not work as they increase catabolism and decrease anabolism 
- Only way is to working out to antiageing
