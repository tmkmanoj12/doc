- There is thing about myths  , the longer they are around the closer they get to facts
- myths  = misinterpreting , misunderstanding, oversimplifying

#### Spot reduction - the mother of all myths

- how the term movement goes with the bowel likewise burning goes with fat
- when you contract your muscle endlessly  - the rectus abdominus in crunches or the abductor in sidekicks  - they produce a by product called _lactic acid_
- this lactic acid is what gives you burn and has really nothing to do with the fat on top of the muscle.
- difference between the muscle and fat tissue is that muscle has the property to contract and relax while fat has the property to sag, it can neither contract nor relax 
- exersice physiologists call it as non working entity
- so when your legs or chest up the floor , the fat just sits there enjoying the __joy ride__ and the muscle overworks and produces a lot of lactic acid , begging your brain to stop the voluntary action /torture
- yes thats why the human body produces the lactic acid
- if the concentration of lactic acid goes beyond a certain limit then the brain gets the signal to stop the activity 
- lactic acid steadily creates increasing burn that muscles to stop the contraction (self -induced) so that the burn or pain can be stopped
- if your lactic acid concentration goes beyond a certian limit it means your muslce is being overworked and there is aresik of snapping  , pulling and breaking
- excersice is to make bones, tendons,ligaments joints stronger  , not weaker
- so when your traine says you to go further he is wrong about no pain no gan statement
- so should you not do spot excersies ? no you have to do them but 15-20 reps once in a week to move those muscles
