- There is thing about myths  , the longer they are around the closer they get to facts
- myths  = misinterpreting , misunderstanding, oversimplifying

#### 1. Spot reduction - the mother of all myths

- how the term movement goes with the bowel likewise burning goes with fat
- when you contract your muscle endlessly  - the rectus abdominus in crunches or the abductor in sidekicks  - they produce a by product called _lactic acid_
- this lactic acid is what gives you burn and has really nothing to do with the fat on top of the muscle.
- difference between the muscle and fat tissue is that muscle has the property to contract and relax while fat has the property to sag, it can neither contract nor relax 
- exersice physiologists call it as non working entity
- so when your legs or chest up the floor , the fat just sits there enjoying the __joy ride__ and the muscle overworks and produces a lot of lactic acid , begging your brain to stop the voluntary action /torture
- yes thats why the human body produces the lactic acid
- if the concentration of lactic acid goes beyond a certain limit then the brain gets the signal to stop the activity 
- lactic acid steadily creates increasing burn that muscles to stop the contraction (self -induced) so that the burn or pain can be stopped
- if your lactic acid concentration goes beyond a certian limit it means your muslce is being overworked and there is aresik of snapping  , pulling and breaking
- excersice is to make bones, tendons,ligaments joints stronger  , not weaker
- so when your traine says you to go further he is wrong about no pain no gan statement
- so should you not do spot excersies ? no you have to do them but 15-20 reps once in a week to move those muscles

#### 2. Running is bad for knees ??
- no
- Running has something called __non contact phase__ where both your feet are off the ground 
- so when you land the foot that strikes the ground lands with more than n4-6 times of bosy weight
- if you havent spent time strendghtining the muscles areound your thigh or streched them , then your injuring it not because you ran , but beacuase you gave a avery little thought for running

- Strectching and strenthening the muscles invloved in running is crucial ; wihtout adequate strenght and flexibility you would injure your knee even if you were not running and just brisk walking or even channel suffering
- the only difference with walking is that you would injure it in 2 years compared to 2 months
- you may think you are so regular with excersice but really you have been equally regular with abuse too

##### Excersice means indulging in activity after proper thought and analysis
- if you did that you would be strengthening and streching too
- Just like marriage gets boring running also causes knee injury - so we have to take care
- instead of spending time on strenghthening and streching we are spending on whatt shoes to buy

> Dont walk on the Threadmill it will ruin your back

- Only walk on treadmills at a speed which you can comfortably do so without having to hold the side bars or the font panel 
- if you burned 500 Kcals or ran at 9.5 or walked for 1 hour but did so by resting your weight on one of treadmils many branches , then you essentially taxed your back (or the most vulnerable weight joint in the body)
and the doctors becoming rivh by treating you
- So when running on treadmill learn to hold your body weight first and learn to run without load shedding on the treadmill and your back will be safe
> Techinique matters more than no of calories


#### 3.If you weight train you will get bulky 

- yes its like if you go to bathroom you will peer
- technically it is called hypertrophy or growth of muscles

- Muscles are the fat burning furnaces of the body
- when you grow a muscle , your body's ability to sport a falt stomach
and a tight butt 
- No body looks like body builder if they went to gym
- When you do excersice your bone density will increase and wil make you look like 25 in your 40
- weight training makes your body a better fat burning machine and also best prevention of disorders like diabeties
- When you stand sideways in a mirror you arms should be bigger than your stomach and smalled than your thigs

#### 4. just do 100 suryanamaskaras!

- stupid people say that it is ancient science and works the whole spine stimulating every chakra in the boy and leads to purification of the system
- yes it is true but when you are not doing in correct posture you doing more harm than good
- do one or two infront of teacher who corrects the posture

#### 5. Sweating melts the fat
- Sweating is a process in our body as a means of thermo regulation,
- means when your core temperature goes of more than normal your body needs to cool , so the body sweats where in the body looses some water , electrolytes and some minerals too
- Sweating too much can cause dehydration
